# A Planner as P-like as It Gets

## Project Overview
'A Planner as P-like as It Gets' is a planner that reflects my habit of organizing places I want to visit on Google Maps and then traveling based on the nearest locations while at my destination. When using Google Maps' place list as is, custom labels are not displayed in the mobile environment, and saved places such as restaurants and tourist attractions are mixed together, making it difficult to decide on the next destination. This planner was created to solve these problems.

## Key Features
- Place search using Google Maps API
- Place saving and management
- Categorization of places
- Custom labeling for each place
- Memo function for places

## Tech Stack
