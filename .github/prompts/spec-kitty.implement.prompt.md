## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Location Pre-flight Check (CRITICAL for AI Agents)

Before proceeding with implementation, verify you are in the correct working directory:

**Check your current branch:**

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**Expected output:** A feature branch like `001-feature-name`
**If you see `main`:** You are in the wrong location!

**This command MUST run from a feature worktree, not the main repository.**

If you're on the `main` branch:

1. Check for available worktrees: `ls .worktrees/`
2. Navigate to the appropriate feature worktree: `cd .worktrees/<feature-name>`
3. Verify you're in the right place: `git branch --show-current` should show the feature branch
4. Then re-run this command

The script will fail if you're not in a feature worktree.
**Path reference rule:** When you mention directories or files, provide either the absolute path or a path relative to the project root (for example, `kitty-specs/<feature>/tasks/`). Never refer to a folder by name alone.

This is intentional - worktrees provide isolation for parallel feature development.

## Outline

1. **Verify worktree context**:
   - The CLI prefers an isolated checkout at `PROJECT_ROOT/.worktrees/FEATURE-SLUG`; use the path returned by `create-new-feature` when it exists.
   - If that directory is present and you are not already inside it, `cd` into the worktree before proceeding.
   - When inspecting git status or listing files, always reference the worktree paths (for example, `kitty-specs/<feature>/...` inside `.worktrees/<feature>/`).
   - If worktree creation was skipped (the CLI returned no worktree path or the directory is missing), remain in the primary checkout on the feature branch or recreate the worktree with `git worktree add PROJECT_ROOT/.worktrees/FEATURE-SLUG FEATURE-SLUG` and then `cd` into it.

2. Run `.kittify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute.

3. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:
     ```
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     ```
   - Calculate overall status:
     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items
   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     - Display the table with incomplete item counts
     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3
   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     - Display the table showing all checklists passed
     - Automatically proceed to step 3

4. **MANDATORY: Initialize Task Workflow** ⚠️ BLOCKING STEP

   **For EACH task you will implement**:

   a. **Move task prompt to doing lane**:

   ```bash
   # Capture your shell PID
   SHELL_PID=$(echo $$)

   # Move prompt (example for T001)
   .kittify/scripts/bash/tasks-move-to-lane.sh FEATURE-SLUG TXXX doing \
     --shell-pid "$SHELL_PID" \
     --agent "claude" \
     --note "Started implementation"
   ```

   > Windows users: run `.kittify/scripts/powershell/tasks-move-to-lane.ps1` with the same arguments.

   b. **Verify frontmatter metadata** in the moved file:

   ```yaml
   lane: 'doing'
   assignee: 'Your Name or Agent ID'
   agent: 'claude' # or codex, gemini, etc.
   shell_pid: '12345' # from echo $$
   ```

   c. **Confirm the Activity Log** shows a new entry that records the transition to `doing` (the helper script adds it automatically—adjust the note if needed).

   d. **Commit the move**:

   ```bash
   git status --short
   git commit -m "Start TXXX: Move to doing lane"
   ```

   **VALIDATION**: Before proceeding to implementation, verify:
   - [ ] Prompt file exists in `tasks/doing/phase-X-name/`
   - [ ] Frontmatter has `lane: "doing"`
   - [ ] Frontmatter has your `shell_pid`
   - [ ] Activity log has "Started implementation" entry
   - [ ] Changes are committed to git

   **If validation fails**: STOP and fix the workflow before implementing.
   (Optional) Run `.kittify/scripts/bash/validate-task-workflow.sh TXXX FEATURE_DIR` for automated checks.

5. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read the task prompt file from `tasks/doing/phase-X-name/TXXX-slug.md` (moved in step 3)
   - **MANDATORY**: Scan the prompt body for reviewer notes or follow-up requests—many tasks return to `planned/` after review with embedded feedback that must drive your next steps.
   - **VERIFY**: Frontmatter shows `lane: "doing"`, `agent`, and `shell_pid`
   - **IF METADATA MISSING**: You skipped step 3. Pause and complete the workflow initialization before continuing.
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

6. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

7. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Pull from planned intentionally**: Select the next task from `tasks/planned/`. If it recently came back from `for_review/`, treat any embedded notes as your starting TODO list and confirm you address each one before closing.
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding
   - **Kanban discipline**: Use the lane helper scripts to keep the prompt in `tasks/doing/`, update the Activity Log, and capture your shell PID (`echo $$`). These should already be complete from step 3—verify before coding.

8. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

9. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - Leave the task checkbox unchecked—reviewers will mark completion when moving the prompt to `tasks/done/`.
   - **After completing each task**:
     - Update the prompt's activity log:
       ```markdown
       - 2025-10-07T17:00:00Z – claude – shell_pid=12345 – lane=doing – Completed implementation
       ```
     - Move prompt to for_review:
     ```bash
     .kittify/scripts/bash/tasks-move-to-lane.sh FEATURE-SLUG TXXX for_review \
       --shell-pid "$SHELL_PID" \
       --agent "claude" \
       --note "Ready for review"
     ```

     - Commit:
       ```bash
       git status --short
       git commit -m "Complete TXXX: Move to for_review lane"
       ```
   - **VALIDATION BEFORE CONTINUING TO NEXT TASK**:
     - [ ] Prompt is in `tasks/for_review/` lane
     - [ ] Frontmatter shows `lane: "for_review"`
     - [ ] Activity log has completion entry
     - [ ] Git commit exists for the move

10. Completion validation:
    - Verify all required tasks are completed
    - Check that implemented features match the original specification
    - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
    - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
    - Report final status with summary of completed work

## Task Workflow Summary (Quick Reference)

**For every task**:

1. **START**: `planned/` → `doing/`
   - `.kittify/scripts/bash/tasks-move-to-lane.sh FEATURE-SLUG WPID doing --note "Started implementation"`
   - Verify frontmatter: `lane: "doing"`, confirm `shell_pid`, `agent`
   - Confirm activity log entry
   - Commit

2. **WORK**: Implement the task
   - Follow prompt guidance
   - Create/modify files as specified
   - Test your changes

3. **COMPLETE**: `doing/` → `for_review/`
   - Add completion entry to activity log
   - `.kittify/scripts/bash/tasks-move-to-lane.sh FEATURE-SLUG WPID for_review --note "Ready for review"`
   - Verify frontmatter: `lane: "for_review"`
   - Confirm review-ready log entry
   - Commit

4. **REVIEW**: Reviewer moves `for_review/` → `done/`
   - Reviewer validates work
   - Reviewer updates tasks.md checkbox (`- [x]`)
   - Reviewer uses the lane helper script to move to `tasks/done/` and commits

**Shell PID**: Capture once per session with `echo $$` and reuse it

**Timestamp format**: ISO 8601 with timezone, e.g. `2025-10-07T16:00:00Z`

**Agent identifiers**: claude, codex, gemini, copilot, cursor, windsurf, etc.

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

## Agent-Specific Parallelization Tips

Leverage your agent’s native orchestration so one work package advances while another gets reviewed:

- **Claude Code** – Use the `/agents` command to spin up specialized subagents and explicitly delegate work (for example, “Use the code-reviewer subagent to audit WP02”) so different assistants run in parallel.[^claude_subagents]
- **OpenAI Codex** – Offload secondary tasks as cloud jobs with commands like `codex exec --cloud "refactor the adapters"`; cloud tasks are designed to run concurrently with your local session.[^codex_cloud]
- **Cursor Agent CLI** – Launch multiple instances (`cursor-agent chat "…"`) in separate terminals or remote shells; the CLI explicitly supports parallel agents.[^cursor_parallel]
- **GitHub Copilot CLI** – Schedule or review background work with `gh agent-task create`, `gh agent-task list`, and `gh agent-task view --log --follow` while you keep implementing locally.[^copilot_agent]
- **Google Gemini CLI** – Pair Gemini with Container Use to open isolated shells (e.g., `cu shell --name=tests -- gemini-cli`) so two Gemini agents can run safely side by side.[^gemini_parallel]
- **Qwen Code** – When you call the `/task` tool, include multiple `task` tool uses in one turn; the bundled guidance explicitly encourages launching several subagents concurrently.[^qwen_task]
- **OpenCode** – The task tool reminds you to “launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible”; start a review subagent while the build agent continues edits.[^opencode_parallel]
- **Amazon Q Developer CLI** – Use Container Use recipes to create multiple isolated Q sessions so one agent handles reviews while another implements new changes.[^amazonq_parallel]

If an agent lacks built-in subagents, mimic the pattern manually: open a second terminal, move a review prompt to `tasks/doing/`, and run the reviewer commands there while your primary session keeps coding.
